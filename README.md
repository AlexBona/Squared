# Squared

<h4>This is my first "advanced Java programming" project. I made it for
an exam during the second year at University. I obtained the maximum mark.</h4>

<h4>When I built it, I had no knowledge about patterns such as MVC for example. 
In fact the code is bad-structured and views and logic are mixed in same classes.
However the game works!</h4>

<h4>I keep this project free to the public, hoping it could help novice developers to find
easy solutions to build up a multithread application.</h4>
